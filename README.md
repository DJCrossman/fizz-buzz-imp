Fizz Buzz Machine - ENSE 479 Engineering Concepts in Sound Art

The final sound art piece I chose construct is an interactive sound sculpture where the viewer will be able to text a number to a specific number to a number and the sound sculpture will playback specific sounds based on the number. The user does not need to be in contact with the object for the object to react to the interaction. The theme is the concept of passion for the web and software. The user will text message the provided number, then Twilio’s service will send the SMS information to Electric Imp’s service where it will communication with the Imp device and produce sounds for the sound sculpture.
